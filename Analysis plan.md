# Analysis Plan
- Your proposed analysis pipeline must include all pre-processing steps, and a precise description of all planned analyses (including appropriate correction for multiple comparisons if applicable). Any covariates or regressors must be stated. Where analysis decisions are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses, these contingencies must be specified and adhered to. 
- Do not include exploratory analyses in the Stage 1 protocol. These should be reported in the Stage 2 manuscript, under the heading Exploratory Analyses.
## Should you need to deviate in any way from the description of your work in the Methods after acceptance in principle, you must seek editorial feedback first (before implementing these changes).
