# Code availability statement
- For Registered Reports, public sharing of all code upon acceptance for publication of the Stage 2 manuscript is mandatory. Please include a statement committing to sharing all code on acceptance of your Stage 2 manuscript. The Code availability statement must be included separately from the Data availability statement. Please provide a link (e.g. GitHub, osf) to a live version of your code. Code used to simulate data, conduct power analyses, and analyse pilot data should be made accessible in the same location. The code must be made available for peer-review, but can be placed under public embargo until Stage 2 acceptance.
