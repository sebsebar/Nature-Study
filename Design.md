# Design
- Your Methods section must include a description of experimental procedures in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat the methodology exactly, without requiring further information other than that included in the protocol, your Supplementary Information file (if used) and, if applicable, the linked Code and Data (please refer to the Code Availability and Data availability statements below).
- Provide full descriptions of any outcome-neutral criteria and positive controls. These quality checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses. 
- You must have a statement on randomization in the Methods, if applicable.
- For experimental studies, make it clear whether the design is within-subjects, between-subjects, mixed, or other.
- You must have a statement indicating whether blinding will be used in the Methods, if applicable. If there will be no blinding, this must be clearly stated in the manuscript, as follows: "Data collection and analysis will not be performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.‚Äù
- If your manuscript reports the results of a Phase 2 or 3 randomized controlled trial, you should also attach the CONSORT checklist with your submission.
