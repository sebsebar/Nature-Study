# Design
- Your Methods section must include a description of experimental procedures in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat the methodology exactly, without requiring further information other than that included in the protocol, your Supplementary Information file (if used) and, if applicable, the linked Code and Data (please refer to the Code Availability and Data availability statements below).
- Provide full descriptions of any outcome-neutral criteria and positive controls. These quality checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses. 
- You must have a statement on randomization in the Methods, if applicable.
- For experimental studies, make it clear whether the design is within-subjects, between-subjects, mixed, or other.
- You must have a statement indicating whether blinding will be used in the Methods, if applicable. If there will be no blinding, this must be clearly stated in the manuscript, as follows: "Data collection and analysis will not be performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.”
- If your manuscript reports the results of a Phase 2 or 3 randomized controlled trial, you should also attach the CONSORT checklist with your submission.

# Our Design
- manipulation check
	- Does our EE work?
	- keep in mind that any rating has thepotential to reduce the intensity of the induced change (e.g., Lieberman,Eisenberger, Crockett, Tom, Pfeifer, & Way, 2007)
		- Maybe have them rate their affective change afterwards?
		- On the other hand, asking participants to retrospectively report their experience later in the experiment also has costs, because memory-based measures have their own biases (Robinson & Clore, 2002).

- VR
	- Methods and typical stimulus sets: e.g., experience of a virtual park (Riva et al., 2007); virtual reality exposure therapy for treating anxiety (e.g., Michaliszyn, Marchand, Bouchard, Martel, & PoirierBisson, 2010). Virtual park: Participants explored a virtual urban park (with trees, benches, lights, walking paths). Affect was induced by changing background music, lighting, shadows, and the presence of other people. Virtual reality exposure therapy: Virtual reality used to induce affect in the treatment of anxiety, particularly for exposure therapy. A meta-analysis showed effects comparable to clinical in vivo exposures (Powers & Emmelkamp, 2008). 
	- Advantages include good experimental control and repeatability, potential for enhanced believability of manipulations, and ability to present well designed social manipulations to heterogeneous samples to enhance generalizability (Blascovich & Bailenson, 2011) 
	- The downside of this technology is the cost and the need for some degree of technological sophistication, especially in programming (Blascovich & Bailenson, 2011)

-  Music
	-  Methods and typical stimulus sets: The Continuous Music Technique (Eich & Metcalfe, 1989) pairs classical music (with no explicit semantic content) with imagined events (either hypothetical or autobiographical) with the intent of intensifying feelings. 
	-  Music can be played in the background to keep evocative states elevated throughout an experiment 
	-  Music does not reliably induce specific discrete emotions (e.g., anger vs. anxiety) although it can induce valence effects (positive vs. negative vs. neutral)
- Risk and rationality paper
	- Ideally, to be able to draw inference on causal relationships, the experimenter would prefer to induce different states of mood by an appropriate procedure (Westermann et al., 1996). Given the large number of observations necessary to reliably estimate risk preference parameters, induced mood is likely not to be sufficiently persistent to last through the session. For this reason, we utilize a self-reported measure constructed from the answers to the question “How has your day been going?”. Our choice of question reflects the characterization of mood as a general background feeling building up as a consequence of prior incidents or conditions in the environment (Parkinson et al., 1996). People come to the lab with a history of experiences made in the course of the day. Presumably, pleasant experiences trigger diffuse feelings of well-being and, consequently, may influence people’s attitudes toward risk (Loewenstein and Lerner, 2003).9
