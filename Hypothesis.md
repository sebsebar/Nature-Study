> Positive affect as information and common currency leads to higher probability estimates and decision weights for gains, while negative affect as information and common currency leads to higher probability estimates and decision weights for losses.
> 3.3.2. Affect as motivator
> Affect as a motivator describes the tendency of emotions to drive specific behavior (Chen and Bargh, 1999); positive and negative feelings are likely to determine the expected outcomes of decisions (Loewenstein and Lerner, 2003, Mellers et al., 1997). In addition, decision outcomes can amplify current moods: Contingent losses from an unfavorable outcome appear more severe when in a positive mood than in a negative one (Isen et al., 1988), whereas negative feelings make a contingent gain from a favorable outcome seem more valuable. Since decision-makers are inclined to maintain good moods or reverse bad ones (Forgas, 1995), we suggest that the effect of anticipated emotions on current mood states results in a shift of the perceived values and subjective utilities of uncertain outcomes. Positive affect in the moment of the decision fuels the fear of impairment, in which case losses loom larger than gains. In contrast, decision-makers in negative moods focus on the opportunity to improve the status quo, resulting in a lower relative valuation of losses than gains. We posit:
