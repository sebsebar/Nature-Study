- Next Step Is To Get On Top Of The Literature (Do Intro so we get on top 
- We have to find the gaps where we’re gonna say stuff differently
- Then the stimuli - We have clear Variables - What are the DV

How do we sell the paper
- Can we combine the Circumplex model and Prospect Theory
- It’s a paper on Emotion and Prospect Theory
	- Start with Prospect Theory -> It’s recently been redone in multiple labs
- Be wary with the priming/elicitation
	- Emotion Elicitation 
		- Music / Priming Procedure takes away from study when reviewers look  on
		- Point to focus on: We have a theory driven instead of Effect Driven setup
- It’s theoretically driven
-  Study 1 (Ultimate Proof of Concept)
- Written stimuli or video can be run very well studied online
- Study 2
- Lab  Study with 60-80 participants showing the same trends
- We can't afford to give thousands to each participant
	- Use Points
	- look at methods of other studes

- Stimuli
	- Can we replicate our findings with both reflection, video, VR -> Similar direction to the effect
	- VR is just a robustness check -> Conservative check
	- It doesn’t matter that it’s VR -> it’s just the most conservative measure
	- - Emotion Elicitation -> Music / Priming Procedure takes away from study -> This is where we have to do
	- We have a theory driven instead of Effect Driven setup
	- VR  -> Reviiewers might say "We don’t know enough"
		- We need to argue that it's a more conservatory tool
	- We can check wheter videoes seem better and reflect on it
		- Do we see the same direction of effect?
	- Do a Pretest (Kinda pilot)
		- 10 Stimuli per condition -> Go out and ask “Tell me how Arousing that is” -> Prep for the main stimuli
			- Satisfy our conditions of score highest of our stimuli
			- If we did this and used multiple stimuli for each condition (3 or 4) -> Ask for  -> Treat as random factor
