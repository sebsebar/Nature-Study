# Pilot Data
- You may include pilot data, for example to demonstrate the feasibility of your approach. Your pilot studies and results should be described briefly in the main manuscript and reported in full in Supplementary Information.
- Pilot data and custom analyses code should be made available and referred to in the Data Availability statement and Code availability statement. You may also include simulated data, for example to support your power analysis. This should also be made available.
- If you report analyses of pilot data using NHST (either in the main text or in Supplementary Information), you must report statistics in full: statistic(degrees of freedom) = value, p = value, effect size statistic = value, % Confidence Intervals = values
