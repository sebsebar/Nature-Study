### A History Of Bringing Economics Down To Earth & Letting Humans Choose Their Own Utility Function

- "Counterarguments - the relevancy of emotion and memory theories
One could argue that EPT already includes a reference point for individuals in their model, but this is a faulty statement, as there’s only talk of a reference point for utility in the dimensions of gain and loss. It fails to incorporate how affective states systematically manipulate these dimensions of gains and losses. Beyond a weighting function, as suggested earlier, one could imagine having the EPT change depending on a reference point in an emotional spectrum, e.g. of Arousal and Valence.

More pressingly an economist might argue that by adding too many predictors to one’s model of decision-making, it also renders it too complicated and thereby useless. – you know, like a tube map is useful, preserving the essential features for navigation whilst removing all non-essential.
But as the famous philosopher Alfred Korzybski  once remarked “The map is not the territory”, and one shouldn’t confuse poor models of reality with reality itself. If research into emotions continues to grow as model 10 shows, and the worlds computational power keeps growing exponentially,  then I see no reason not to use more realistic and complex models. Let me draw a picture of what I mean: If U were to rebuild cities or political schemes, would you want to use a tube map for placing your new buildings or guiding your new actions? No, this would be completely upside down. You would want to have as clear a picture of reality as possible, so you wouldn’t trample down whole neighbourhoods or bulldoze whole fractions of society to make reality conform to a fictitious picture one’s economic model/tube map has painted.

- "In a more granulated fashion, multiple studies found that the specific emotions of fear and anger also manipulated the risk-tendencies in both gain- and ‘loss scenaria’. In this one study we see a vanishing effect of loss-aversion, conflicting with another one of EPT’s tenants – that “Loses Loom Larger”"

##### Study 1.1
- " Parameters a and ? represent concavity of the value function, and the degree of loss aversion. The probability weighting function is linear if a = 1, as it is in EU. If a < 1, the weighting function is inverted S-shaped, i.e., individuals overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities, as shown by Tversky and Kahneman (1992). If a > 1, then the weighting function is S-shaped, i.e., individuals underweight small probabilities and overweight large probabilities. The above model reduces to EU (with a reflected utility function at zero) if a = 1 and ? "

#### Study 2
- "In a study of decision frames and choice under uncertainty, Participants showed risk-seeking in a ‘gain scenario’ when simultaneously feeling pleasant feelings, and also risk-aversion in a ‘loss scenario’ when feeling glum. This goes against the concavity of the function in a ‘gain scenario’ and the convexity of the function in the ‘loss scenario’."

- "By manipulating the emotion valence of episodic prospection, our findings suggested that positive emotion made individuals tend to choose delayed rewards, while negative emotion made individuals tend to choose immediate rewards. Only imaging events with neutral emotion did not affect individuals' choice preference. Thus, the valence of imaged future events' emotion might play an important role in individuals' intertemporal choice. It is possible that the valence of emotion may affect the changed direction (promote or inhibit) of individuals' delay discounting, while the ability to image future events affects the changed degree of individuals' delay discounting."

# Ideas from Seb
- Movies to elicit emotions
- Prospect Theory Example Tasks
	- Used in their  original work
- Look into the design and discussions of the different papers
- Arousal and Valence

## Ideas from Panos
**How to**
- Theory building: Modernize the theory conceptually and then test this new theory
- Build on the other studies: Respond to the call for further experimentation -> There's a recipe
	- This is the one Panos opts for
**Set-Up**
- Possible to do it online
- Attention checks for video stimuli
	- 1 or 2 online studies
