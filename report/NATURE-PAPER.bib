            This paper presents a computational framework for providing affective labels to real-life situations, called A-Situ. We first define an affective situation, as a specific arrangement of affective entities relevant to emotion elicitation in a situation. Then, the affective situation is represented as a set of labels in the valence-arousal emotion space. Based on psychological behaviors in response to a situation, the proposed framework quantifies the expected emotion evoked by the interaction with a stimulus event. The accumulated result in a spatiotemporal situation is represented as a polynomial curve called the affective curve, which bridges the semantic gap between cognitive and affective perception in real-world situations. We show the efficacy of the curve for reliable emotion labeling in real-world experiments, respectively concerning (1) a comparison between the results from our system and existing explicit assessments for measuring emotion, (2) physiological distinctiveness in emotional states, and (3) physiological characteristics correlated to continuous labels. The efficiency of affective curves to discriminate emotional states is evaluated through subject-dependent classification performance using bicoherence features to represent discrete affective states in the valence-arousal space. Furthermore, electroencephalography-based statistical analysis revealed the physiological correlates of the affective curves.},

	abstract = {Emotions play a critical role in our daily lives, so the understanding and recognition of emotional responses is crucial for human research. Aﬀective computing research has mostly used non-immersive two-dimensional (2D) images or videos to elicit emotional states. However, immersive virtual reality, which allows researchers to simulate environments in controlled laboratory conditions with high levels of sense of presence and interactivity, is becoming more popular in emotion research. Moreover, its synergy with implicit measurements and machine-learning techniques has the potential to impact transversely in many research areas, opening new opportunities for the scientiﬁc community. This paper presents a systematic review of the emotion recognition research undertaken with physiological and behavioural measures using head-mounted displays as elicitation devices. The results highlight the evolution of the ﬁeld, give a clear perspective using aggregated analysis, reveal the current open issues and provide guidelines for future research.},

	abstract = {Experimental research into emotion has struggled with the lack of ecological validity of the testing paradigms. One potential way to deal with that issue is through the use of virtual reality (VR), which allows immersive experiences in controlled settings. Previous reviews have focused on the clinical use of VR, but there has been no attempt to summarise findings in relation to emotion elicitation through VR. This systematic review compiles studies that have used VR as an emotion induction paradigm. Four databases were used (Web of Science, Science Direct, PsycInfo and PubMed), with a total of 61 articles fitting the inclusion criteria. In most studies, participants were college students, with the most common emotions elicited being anxiety, relaxation, fear and joy. The VR equipment employed included the Head-Mounted Display, the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment, videogames and computers, with almost all studies using subjective measures of emotion and approximately half of them including physiological measures also. The findings suggest that VR is an effective tool to induce emotion in lab settings. Future research should focus, in particular, in the integration of subjective and physiological outcomes and ways of fostering immersion. Furthermore, exploration of the psychological mechanism of emotion elicitation using VR (e.g. embodiment) could lead to new technical advances for the research of emotion.},

	abstract = {Detecting abrupt correlation changes in multivariate time series is crucial in many application fields such as signal processing, functional neuroimaging, climate studies, and financial analysis. To detect such changes, several promising correlation change tests exist, but they may suffer from severe loss of power when there is actually more than one change point underlying the data. To deal with this drawback, we propose a permutation based significance test for Kernel Change Point (KCP) detection on the running correlations. Given a requested number of change points K, KCP divides the time series into K + 1 phases by minimizing the within-phase variance. The new permutation test looks at how the average within-phase variance decreases when K increases and compares this to the results for permuted data. The results of an extensive simulation study and applications to several real data sets show that, depending on the setting, the new test performs either at par or better than the state-of-the art significance tests for detecting the presence of correlation changes, implying that its use can be generally recommended.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

In addition, appraisal theories assume that an appraisal component elicits changes in the other emotion components (e.g., motivational, behavioural, experiential). Neither the componential definition of emotion nor appraisal theory have been systematically translated to paradigms for emotion induction, many of which rely on passive emotion induction without a clear theoretical framework. As a result, the observed emotions are often weak. This study explored the potential of virtual reality (VR) to evoke strong emotions in ecologically valid scenarios that fully engaged the mental and bodily components of the participant. Participants played several VR games and reported on their emotions. Multivariate analyses using hierarchical clustering and multilevel linear modelling showed that participants experienced intense, multi-componential emotions in VR. We identified joy and fear clusters of responses, each involving changes in appraisal, motivation, physiology, feeling, and regulation. Appraisal variables were found to be the most predictive for fear and joy intensities, compared to other emotion components, and were found to explain individual differences in VR scenarios, as predicted by appraisal theory. The results advocate upgraded methodologies for the induction and analysis of emotion processes.},

Firstly, the emotional multi-features were extracted and classified from the existing standard affective systems. Then the VR scenes were designed by writing scripts, building 3D modeling and scenes using Unreal Engine 4.12. Through Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) evaluation, it was verified that the emotions inducted by the VR scenes were evenly distributed in the three-dimensional space of emotion, which reached the standardization of affective system in field of psychology. Then we further validated the advantages of AVRS by putting the four VR scenes into the LCD and VR device respectively. We tested the arousal level with the heart rate data and the SAM scale. The result shows that the arousal of other scenes have no significant difference from the videos in the VR environment, except the fear scene. We found that there are some conditions for the VR scenes to achieve a good emotional effect. Enhancing the interactivity and plot design is an important aspect.},

We show awareness of emotional faces is gradual rather than dichotomous, and that the effects of emotional priming are predicted by the level of perceptual awareness of emotional faces, with no effects when reported unseen. The results question how much unconscious perceptions can influence behaviour. As priming is one of the most well-established phenomena believed to occur unconsciously, the results expand the growing body of evidence that questions the contributions of unconscious processing on behaviour.},

	abstract = {Affect is a fundamental aspect of the human mind. An increasing number of experiments attempt to examine the influence of affect on other psychological phenomena. To accomplish this research, it is necessary to experimentally modify participants' affective states. In the present experiment, we compared the efficacy of four commonly used affect induction procedures. Participants (38 healthy undergraduate students: 18 males) were randomly assigned to either a pleasant or an unpleasant affect induction group, and then underwent four different affect induction procedures: (1) recall of an affectively salient event accompanied by affectively congruent music, (2) script-driven guided imagery, (3) viewing images while listening to affectively congruent music, and (4) posing affective facial actions, body postures, and vocal expressions. All four affect induction methods were successful in inducing both pleasant and unpleasant affective states. The viewing image with music and recall with music procedures were most effective in enhancing positive affect, whereas the viewing image with music procedure was most effective in enhancing negative affect. Implications for the scientific study of affect are discussed.},

	abstract = {Affect inductions have become essential for testing theories of affect and for conducting experimental research on the effects of mood and emotion. The current review takes stock of the vast body of existing literature on affect induction procedures (AIPs; also referred to as mood inductions) to evaluate the effectiveness of affect inductions as research tools and to test theories of affect (e.g., the bipolarity hypothesis, negativity bias, positivity offset, and theories of emotionality and gender) using meta-analytic data. In doing so, we seek to address whether AIPs are effective for inducing affective states, what conditions maximize their effectiveness, for which emotions they are most effective, for whom they are most effective, and whether affect induction findings can provide insight into theories of affect. A meta-analysis of 874 samples and 53,509 participants suggests that affect inductions are effective on average (δ = 1.32), but this effectiveness varies with the type of affect induction, the emotion being induced, and the gender of the participants. Further, results indicate coupled activation where the induction of positive (negative) emotions leads to a corresponding reduction in negative (positive) emotions, which provides support for the bipolar continuum of positive and negative affect. Results also revealed a negativity bias in which individuals display stronger reactions to negative stimuli than positive stimuli. A practical guide in the choice of affect induction procedures for researchers is presented and implications for emotion theory are discussed.

Public Significance Statement—This meta-analysis illustrates the effectiveness of affect inductions as a tool for changing one’s emotional state. However, the effectiveness of these procedures varies substantially across how, why, and to whom these inductions are administered, illustrating the importance of careful thought when choosing the best way to enhance (or reduce) one’s emotional state.

The main goal of the present study was to develop and test the effectiveness of a new and comprehensive set of emotional film excerpts. Fifty film experts were asked to remember specific film scenes that elicited fear, anger, sadness, disgust, amusement, tenderness, as well as emotionally neutral scenes. For each emotion, the 10 most frequently mentioned scenes were selected and cut into film clips. Next, 364 participants viewed the film clips in individual laboratory sessions and rated each film on multiple dimensions. Results showed that the film clips were effective with regard to several criteria such as emotional discreteness, arousal, positive and negative affect. Finally, ranking scores were computed for 24 classification criteria: Subjective arousal, positive and negative affect (derived from the PANAS; Watson \& Tellegen, 1988), a positive and a negative affect scores derived from the Differential Emotions Scale (DES; Izard et al., 1974), six emotional discreteness scores (for anger, disgust, sadness, fear, amusement and tenderness), and 15 “mixed feelings” scores assessing the effectiveness of each film excerpt to produce blends of specific emotions. In addition, a number of emotionally neutral film clips were also validated. The database and editing instructions to construct the film clips have been made freely available in a website.},

These networks are hypothesized to process aspects of emotional experiences that are not unique to a specific emotional category (e.g., “sadness,” “happiness”), but rather that generalize across categories. In this article, we examined the dynamic interactions (i.e., changing cohesiveness) between specific domain-general networks across time while participants experienced various instances of sadness, fear, and anger. We used a novel method for probing the network connectivity dynamics between two salience networks and three amygdala-based networks. We hypothesized, and found, that the functional connectivity between these networks covaried with the intensity of different emotional experiences. Stronger connectivity between the dorsal salience network and the medial amygdala network was associated with more intense ratings of emotional experience across six different instances of the three emotion categories examined. Also, stronger connectivity between the dorsal salience network and the ventrolateral amygdala network was associated with more intense ratings of emotional experience across five out of the six different instances. Our findings demonstrate that a variety of emotional experiences are associated with dynamic interactions of domain-general neural systems.},

Kahneman and Tversky’s 1979 study tested financial choices under risk, concluding that such judgements deviate significantly from the assumptions of expected utility theory, which had remarkable impacts on science, policy and industry. Though substantial evidence supports prospect theory, many presumed canonical theories have drawn scrutiny for recent replication failures. In response, we directly test the original methods in a multinational study (n = 4,098 participants, 19 countries, 13 languages), adjusting only for current and local currencies while requiring all participants to respond to all items. The results replicated for 94\% of items, with some attenuation. Twelve of 13 theoretical contrasts replicated, with 100\% replication in some countries. Heterogeneity between countries and intra-individual variation highlight meaningful avenues for future theorizing and applications. We conclude that the empirical foundations for prospect theory replicate beyond any reasonable thresholds.},

	abstract = {Emotions are highly influential to many psychological processes. Indeed, research employing emotional stimuli is rapidly escalating across the field of psychology. However, challenges remain regarding discrete evocation of frequently co-elicited emotions such as amusement and happiness, or anger and disgust. Further, as much contemporary work in emotion employs college students, we sought to additionally evaluate the efficacy of film clips to discretely elicit these more challenging emotions in a young adult population using an online medium. The internet is an important tool for investigating responses to emotional stimuli, but validations of emotionally evocative film clips across laboratory and web-based settings are limited in the literature. An additional obstacle is identifying stimuli amidst the numerous film clip validation studies. During our investigation, we recognized the lack of a categorical database to facilitate rapid identification of useful film clips for individual researchers’ unique investigations. Consequently, here we also sought to produce the first compilation of such stimuli into an accessible and comprehensive catalog. We based our catalog upon prior work as well as our own, and identified 24 articles and 295 film clips from four decades of research. We present information on the validation of these clips in addition to our own research validating six clips using online administration settings. The results of our search in the literature and our own study are presented in tables designed to facilitate and improve a selection of highly valid film stimuli for future research.},

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of this method when positive, negative and neutral emotional targets are studied under similar experimental conditions is currently unknown. This comprehensive meta-analysis included only studies that implemented neutral, positive and negative mood inductions to evaluate the effectiveness of the film clip method as a mood induction procedure. In addition, several factors related to the films, sample and experimental procedure used, the number of emotional categories, for example, or the number of film clips watched, were included to study their influence on the effectiveness of this mood induction procedure. Forty-five studies were included with 6675 participants and 12 possible moderator variables according to the sample and the research procedure. Our findings suggest that film clips are especially powerful in inducing negative mood states (Hedges’ g for valence = -1.49 and for arousal = -1.77) although they are also effective inducers of positive mood states (Hedges’ g for valence of = . -1.22 and for arousal = -1.34). Additionally, this meta-analysis reveals that variables, such as the number of emotional categories or the type of stimulus used to measure the baseline, should be considered.},

	abstract = {Nilsson, Rieskamp, and Wagenmakers (2011) implemented a hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedure for cumulative prospect theory (CPT; Tversky and Kahneman (1992)). Nilsson et al. used a simplified version of CPT that holds for choice options with mixed outcomes, that is, one positive and one negative payoff. However, for choice options with only gains or only losses, the model specification does not hold. Here we provide a corrected model specification of CPT, one that also holds for options with only gains or only losses. We show that the corrected version does not change the qualitative results reported in Nilsson et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Emotions are collective functional behaviors and action dispositions which has significant effects in our perception, thinking and behavior. The aim of our study is to detect and recognize the human emotion using SAM (Self-Assessment Manikin) rating. The objective of this study is to find the emotions of south Indian subjects and the classical dancers in addition to determine whether the perceived emotions are the same. Methods: A strong stimulus is need for inducing an emotion. Hence International Affective Picture System (IAPS) developed by the National Institute of Mental Health Center for the Study of Emotion and Attention at the University of Florida was used in our study. Fifty five subjects participated in the experiment (20 Males, 20 Females, and 15 Classical dancers). In this present study, a distinct attempt has been made by including the classical dancers among the group of participants. The perceived emotions are recorded in three dimensional spaces (valence, arousal, and dominance domain) for the Indian subjects using Self-Assessment Manikin Scale (SAM). Results: The male perceived the pleasant pictures in valence space as pleased and in arousal space it was excited (rs=0.511) in dominance space as dependant (rs=0.301). while female (rs=0.405) and classical dancers (rs=0.551) perceived the pleasant pictures in valence space as pleasant and in arousal space it was excited, as well as in dominance space as dependant (rs=0.202), (rs=0.210). The unpleasant pictures were rated as unpleasant by all in valance space whereas in arousal space female and male rated in arousal space rated as was dull (rs=0.222) and classical dancers as wide awake (rs=0.480). Whereas female (rs=0.170) and classical dancers (rs=0.332) rated dependant in dominance space. The neutral pictures were perceived as neutral by males, females and classical dancers. Conclusion: As emotion is subjective and it varies across culture, the valence scoring is same for gender to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral stimuli. The variations were noted in arousal and dominance space. The study concludes classical dancers perceived emotion for all the three categories of stimulus (pleasant/unpleasant/neutral) better when compared with female and male.},

Furthermore, evidence from neuro-biology shows that the natural mental processes of human beings will result in decision making patterns that differ from what is predicted and implicit in cumulative prospect theory and prospect theory. Decision making and risk assessment are multi-criteria processes that typically require some processing of information, and thus cannot be defined accurately by rigid quantitative models. CPT/PT do not incorporate the many psychological, legal, biological, knowledge, and situational price-dynamic factors inherent in decision making. Thus, there is a need for more realistic decision models.},

	abstract = {titled "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk." The paper presented a new model of
risk attitudes called "prospect theory," which elegantly captured the experimental evidence on risk taking, including the documented violations of expected utility. More than 30 years later,
prospect theory is still widely viewed as the best available description of how people evaluate risk in experimental settings. However, there are still relatively few well-known and broadly
accepted applications of prospect theory in economics. One might be tempted to conclude that, even if prospect theory is an excellent description of behavior in experimental settings, it is less relevant outside the laboratory. In my view, this lesson would be incorrect. Over the past decade, researchers in the field of behavioral economics have put a lot of thought into how prospect theory should be applied in economic settings. This effort is bearing fruit. A significant body of theoretical work now incorporates the ideas in prospect theory into more traditional models of economic behavior, and a growing body of empirical work tests the predictions of these new theories. I am optimistic that some insights of prospect theory will eventually find a permanent and significant place in mainstream economic analysis.},

CPT is a formal model with parameters that quantify psychological processes such as loss aversion, subjective values of gains and losses, and subjective probabilities. In practical applications of CPT, the model’s parameters are usually estimated using a singleparticipant maximum likelihood approach. The present study shows the advantages of an alternative, hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation procedure. Performance of the procedure is illustrated with a parameter recovery study and application to a real data set. The work reveals that without particular constraints on the parameter space, CPT can produce loss aversion without the parameter that has traditionally been associated with loss aversion. In general, the results illustrate that inferences about people’s decision processes can crucially depend on the method used to estimate model parameters.},

	abstract = {Many important decisions are made under stress and they often involve risky alternatives. There has been ample evidence that stress influences decision making, but still very little is known about whether individual attitudes to risk change with exposure to acute stress. To directly evaluate the causal effect of psychosocial stress on risk attitudes, we adopt an experimental approach in which we randomly expose participants to a stressor in the form of a standard laboratory stress-induction procedure: the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups. Risk preferences are elicited using a multiple price list format that has been previously shown to predict risk-oriented behavior out of the laboratory. Using three different measures (salivary cortisol levels, heart rate and multidimensional mood questionnaire scores), we show that stress was successfully induced on the treatment group. Our main result is that for men, the exposure to a stressor (intention-to-treat effect, ITT) and the exogenously induced psychosocial stress (the average treatment effect on the treated, ATT) significantly increase risk aversion when controlling for their personal characteristics. The estimated treatment difference in certainty equivalents is equivalent to 69 \% (ITT) and 89 \% (ATT) of the gender-difference in the control group. The effect on women goes in the same direction, but is weaker and insignificant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

CPT is a formal model with parameters that quantify psychological processes such as loss aversion, subjective values of gains and losses, and subjective probabilities. In practical applications of CPT, the model’s parameters are usually estimated using a singleparticipant maximum likelihood approach. The present study shows the advantages of an alternative, hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation procedure. Performance of the procedure is illustrated with a parameter recovery study and application to a real data set. The work reveals that without particular constraints on the parameter space, CPT can produce loss aversion without the parameter that has traditionally been associated with loss aversion. In general, the results illustrate that inferences about people’s decision processes can crucially depend on the method used to estimate model parameters.},
